# Economic Transformation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the transformation of the Illinois County Wage Gap Analysis from a basic descriptive study to a comprehensive **economics research project** with proper theoretical foundation, identification strategies, and policy analysis.

## What We Added

### 1. Economic Framework (`ECONOMIC_FRAMEWORK.md`)

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- **Mincer Earnings Equation**: `ln(w_i) = α + β₁S_i + β₂X_i + β₃Z_i + γ₁D_i + γ₂(D_i × S_i) + ε_i`
- **Discrimination Theory**: Taste-based vs. statistical discrimination (Becker 1957, Arrow 1973)
- **Spatial Equilibrium**: Roback (1982) framework for local labor markets

**Identification Strategy:**
- **Instrumental Variables**: Distance to land-grant colleges for education
- **Natural Experiments**: Minimum wage variation, manufacturing decline
- **Fixed Effects**: County-year and county-demographic specifications

**Structural Interpretation:**
- **Elasticity Calculations**: Education, experience, discrimination elasticities
- **Welfare Implications**: Deadweight loss, consumer/producer surplus
- **Counterfactual Scenarios**: Perfect competition, equal education, policy interventions

### 2. Literature Review (`LITERATURE_REVIEW.md`)

**Key Papers Reviewed:**
1. **Blau & Kahn (2017)** - Gender wage gap trends and explanations
2. **Autor et al. (2003)** - Skill-biased technical change
3. **Card & Krueger (1992)** - School quality and earnings
4. **Moretti (2004)** - Human capital externalities
5. **Bertrand & Mullainathan (2004)** - Racial discrimination

**Research Gaps Identified:**
- Limited spatial analysis at county level
- Missing policy simulation work
- Lack of structural interpretation
- Insufficient identification strategies

**Our Contributions:**
- County-level spatial analysis
- Policy simulation framework
- Economic magnitude estimates
- Multiple identification strategies

### 3. Economic Analysis Module (`src/economic_analysis.py`)

**New Methods Implemented:**

#### Mincer Earnings Equation
```python
def mincer_earnings_equation(self, log_wages=True):
    """
    Estimate Mincer earnings equation with discrimination terms.
    Model: ln(w_i) = α + β₁S_i + β₂X_i + β₃Z_i + γ₁D_i + γ₂(D_i × S_i) + ε_i
    """
```

#### Instrumental Variables Analysis
```python
def instrumental_variables_analysis(self):
    """
    Implement instrumental variables analysis using distance to land-grant colleges.
    First stage: Education = α + β₁Distance + β₂Controls + ε
    Second stage: ln(Wage) = γ + δ₁Education_hat + δ₂Controls + ν
    """
```

#### Natural Experiment Analysis
```python
def natural_experiment_analysis(self):
    """
    Analyze natural experiments using minimum wage variation and manufacturing decline.
    Treatment: High minimum wage counties, high manufacturing counties
    """
```

#### Structural Interpretation
```python
def structural_interpretation(self):
    """
    Provide structural interpretation of results with economic magnitudes.
    - Elasticity calculations
    - Welfare implications
    - Policy implications
    """
```

#### Policy Simulation
```python
def policy_simulation(self, policy_type='pay_transparency'):
    """
    Simulate policy interventions and estimate their effects.
    - Pay transparency laws
    - Education subsidies
    - Counterfactual scenarios
    """
```
