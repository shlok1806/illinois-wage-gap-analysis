# Literature Review: County-Level Wage Gap Analysis

## 1. Introduction

This literature review positions our county-level wage gap analysis within the broader economics literature on wage inequality, discrimination, and spatial economics. We focus on five key areas: (1) gender wage gaps, (2) racial wage gaps, (3) spatial wage variation, (4) policy interventions, and (5) methodological approaches.

## 2. Gender Wage Gaps

## 5. Policy Interventions

### 5.1 Card & Krueger (1992) - "School Quality and Black-White Relative Earnings"

**Key Findings:**

- Focus on education policy

**Our Extension:**
- County-level education policies
- Local funding formulas
- Spatial variation in policy effects

### 5.2 Neumark & Wascher (2008) - "Minimum Wages and Employment"

- Distributional benefits significant

**Methodology:**
- Meta-analysis of minimum wage studies
- Focus on employment effects
- Limited analysis of wage effects

**Our Extension:**
- County-level minimum wage variation

## 6. Methodological Approaches

### 6.1 Oaxaca-Blinder Decomposition

**Application:**
- Decompose wage gaps into explained and unexplained components
- Widely used in discrimination studies

**Our Use:**
- County-level decompositions
- Spatial variation in components
- Policy-relevant breakdowns

### 6.2 Instrumental Variables

**Application:**
- Address endogeneity in education-wage relationship
- Natural experiments provide identification
- Exclusion restrictions crucial

**Our Use:**
- Distance to colleges as instrument
- Historical variation in policies
- Geographic instruments

### 6.3 Difference-in-Differences

**Application:**

**Our Use:**
- Minimum wage policy changes
- Education policy reforms
- Local policy interventions

## 7. Research Gaps and Our Contributions

## 8. Theoretical Framework

### 8.1 Human Capital Theory

- Wage differentials reflect human capital differences
- Investment decisions based on returns

**Our Application:**
- County-level education variation
- Spatial differences in returns
- Policy interventions

### 8.2 Discrimination Theory

**Becker (1957):**
- Taste-based discrimination
- Statistical discrimination
- Market forces and discrimination

**Our Application:**
- County-level discrimination variation
- Spatial differences in discrimination
- Policy interventions

### 8.3 Spatial Equilibrium

**Roback (1982):**
- Workers and firms choose locations
- Wages and rents adjust
- Amenities affect location choices

**Our Application:**
- County-level spatial equilibrium
- Local labor market conditions
- Policy effects on location

## 9. Conclusion

Our county-level wage gap analysis builds on and extends the existing literature in several key ways:

1. **Spatial Analysis**: We provide the first comprehensive county-level analysis of wage gaps within a state, revealing important spatial heterogeneity.

2. **Policy Relevance**: We develop a policy simulation framework that estimates the effects of local interventions on wage gaps.

3. **Structural Interpretation**: We move beyond descriptive statistics to provide economic magnitudes and welfare implications.

4. **Identification Strategy**: We employ multiple identification strategies including instrumental variables and natural experiments.

5. **Theoretical Foundation**: We ground our analysis in established economic theory while extending it to the local level.

This research contributes to both the academic literature on wage inequality and provides practical insights for policymakers at the local level.
